# Praveshan 2023

## Why must we choose you?

I’m a tech geek with a strong passion for building things. When I heard about amFOSS, I knew this would be my bridge to a better future. While doing the tasks, I got exposed to so many new things like web scraping and building extentions which gave me a whole new prespective of coding. Amfoss, for me, is not just a club but a hub where I could get whole lots of opportunites and quality mentorship. And I am determined and commited to do my best and contribute will all my heart.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
	
For the next six months, I'm diving into full-stack and app development. Picture it like learning the language and tools to build cool websites and apps. I'll be doing lots of hands-on projects to practice what I learn. Every day, I'll spend time coding, kind of like doing exercises to get better. Also, I want to create a bunch of projects to put it on my resume. My goal is to not just explore but really get good at this stuff for the future!

## How would you contribute back to the club?

I will be doing all the task alloted to me within deadline. Beyond that, I'm here to support my fellow club members, whether it's sharing knowledge, or offering a helping hand. I want you to know that hard work is my middle name, and giving up is just not in my vocabulary. I believe in trying, trying, and trying again, even if it takes a thousand attempts. With your support, I believe I can grow exponentially.

## Include any thoughts or feedback you have on the praveshan process as well.
The over-all process was good. The tasks were exciting and some of them were new to me. I got a falvor of what amFOSS is all about and I am glad I got to participate in the Praveshan 2023.
