#### [task-03](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-03): Hello, World!

I was familiar with the Python, C, Javascript, Java(basic), C++, and I learned Ruby(basics) and for Elixir, Rust and Haskell, I used internet. <br>
PS- I didn't search the codes, instead I looked for ways to input, and run loops cuz  I knew the logic.
