## Overview
"Sky Spy" is a Chrome extension that provides real-time weather information for a given location entered by the user. Users can view the current weather conditions, temperature, and more for their current location or any other city they search for. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Project Structure
- **HTML:** The structure of the web page is defined in HTML. It includes containers for displaying weather information, an input field to enter city names, and a button to fetch weather data.
- **CSS:** The CSS file is used for styling the web page, including fonts, colors, layout, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is responsible for fetching weather data, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the web page content.

## Functionality
- **Weather Data Retrieval:** The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on either the user's current location (using geolocation) or a city name entered by the user.
- **Display Weather:** The retrieved weather data is displayed on the web page, including the city name, temperature, feels-like temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather condition.

## Project Highlights
- **Responsive Design:** The web page is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Smooth Animations:** Animations and transitions are added for a smoother user experience, such as color transitions on hover.
- **Background Image:** A dynamic background image is used to enhance the visual appeal of the application.

## Next Steps
The "Sky Spy" project can be further improved and expanded in several ways:
- Implement a 5-day weather forecast for the selected city.
- Add support for displaying weather information in Fahrenheit in addition to Celsius.
- Include more detailed weather information such as humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.
- Implement user accounts or settings to allow users to save their preferred units and locations.

## Conclusion
"Sky Spy" is a handy weather extention that is created for people like Kalashnikov, which will keep him well informed about the weather at his next rendezvous location so that he can prepare and dress accordingly to not get reprimanded by his superiors again. ;-)
